This was a quite demanding triangular walk from Coniston, taking in three notable peaks (four for those who were very keen) and some spectacular scenery.

We drove to and from the Lakes; [The Sun Inn] at Coniston kindly allowed us to leave our cars in their car park for the weekend.

- *Day 2*: Coniston to Wasdale Head, over the Old Man and via the Woolpack
- *Day 3*: Wasdale Head to Grasmere, over Scafell Pike and High Raise
- *Day 4*: Grasmere to Coniston

Travelling up to the Lake District on Thursday morning meant time for one of the numerous circular walks from Coniston in the afternoon.  Hawkshead and back is a possibility or just north-east of Coniston is Tarn Hows, to which we rambled over some pleasant countryside and along part of the Cumbria Way.

# Friday - Coniston to Wasdale Head

- *Distance*: 16.5 miles
- *Height gain*: 3800ft (more if you go over Harter Fell)
- *Walking time*: 9.5 hrs
- *Difficulty*: Very tough
- *Lunch*: packed lunch bought in Coniston
- *Accommodation*: [Lingmell House B&B]

This day started off going over the Old Man of Coniston, which is steep and sudden but with dramatic views from the top.  We then headed down the other side to cross to Harter Fell, which half of our party went over and half went around, meeting again at the [Woolpack] Inn.  We then pushed on for the last 5.5 miles over to finish at [The Wasdale Head Inn].

We did this walk in mid-October.  We were very lucky with the weather but the slightly shorter days meant that our walk into Wasdale Head came in after dusk (having set off in the morning a bit later than planned).

# Saturday - Wasdale Head to Grasmere

- *Distance*: 12.75 miles
- *Height gain*: 4100ft
- *Walking time*: 9.5 hrs
- *Difficulty*: **Really** tough
- *Lunch*: packed lunch bought from [The Wasdale Head Inn]
- *Accommodation*: [Grasmere Youth Hostel]

There are two mountains on this route - Scafell Pike and High Raise.  The former is quite a formidable upwards hike, the latter a rocky descent.  In between is some beautifully wild Lakeland countryside.

Near the top, Scafell Pike presents itself as a rocky escarpment.  Normal people follow the path to the left.  We went up the scree slope to the right, however, which is very very steep, particularly when carrying a backpack.

# Sunday - Grasmere to Coniston

- *Distance*: 8.75 miles
- *Height gain*: 1400ft
- *Walking time*: 4 hrs
- *Difficulty*: Medium

A relatively straightforward walk with only a smallish climb to cross between the Langdales from Grasmere.
