I'm an Integration Architect. This means that I work in IT and am adept at getting different systems talking to one another.  I've been doing this for years, working both in financial services and retail.

This blog aims to provide the sort of technical help I would personally have found useful and which I was unable to find when I was scrabbling around, trying to get something to work.

I also spend a weekend a year walking with friends.  We generally try to do a linear or circular walk over three or four days.  I've often been asked for information about the routes we've taken and so you can find those here, too.

In my spare time, I play the guitar.  After 25 years of raucous volume, I now predominantly play as part of an acoustic duo, imaginatively entitled [Natalie and Jeremy][NatalieAndJeremy].
