Hello.  Thanks for visiting my blog; I hope you find it useful.

I'm an IT architect, which means I'm a generalist in technology.  I've been doing this for many years - in financial services, retail, logistics and now energy.  This blog originally aimed to provide the sort of technical help I would personally have found useful and which I was unable to find when I was scrabbling around trying to get something to work.  And there are indeed a few such posts here.

However...

I spend a weekend or two a year walking with friends.  We generally try to do a linear or circular walk over three or four days.  I've often been asked for information about the routes we've taken and this now seems to form the majority of my posts.

I live in a nice Georgian market town called **Ampthill**, which is in Bedfordshire, a mildly neglected part of the UK.  It's not quite in East Anglia; it's not one of the home counties; it's not in the Midlands and it's not in the South-East.  I rather like it.

In my spare time, I play the guitar.  After three decades of raucousness, I now predominantly play fingerstyle acoustic, just like my daddy done.  You can find some stuff that I've done on most streaming services or my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@goochjs){:target="\_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
